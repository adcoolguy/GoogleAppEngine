# Autogenerated bulkloader.yaml file.
# You must edit this file before using it. TODO: Remove this line when done.
# At a minimum address the items marked with TODO:
#  * Fill in connector and connector_options
#  * Review the property_map.
#    - Ensure the 'external_name' matches the name of your CSV column,
#      XML tag, etc.
#    - Check that __key__ property is what you want. Its value will become
#      the key name on import, and on export the value will be the Key
#      object.  If you would like automatic key generation on import and
#      omitting the key on export, you can remove the entire __key__
#      property from the property map.

# If you have module(s) with your model classes, add them here. Also
# change the kind properties to model_class.
