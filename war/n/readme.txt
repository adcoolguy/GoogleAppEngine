Why?
. To evaluate and compare AngularJS, RiotJS with ReactJS implementations
. AngularJS (1.4+) supposed to be the "legacy" UI
. RiotJS supposed to be 10 times smaller and faster compared to ReactJS
. CRUD of SR is used as a model after app

What else I need to know?
. To ensure compatibility between the future's Web Component, please define all custom element names with more than one words separated by a hypen e.g. my-first-element!

Apimatic (AngularJS)
. c.f. https://apimatic.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210119918-Using-your-generated-Angular-JS-SDK
. Apimatic artifacts were generated based on /swagger/swagger.json, renamed from ServiceManager-AngularJS to apimatic and moved into js/

Swagger Client
. The JavaScript client is based on https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-client
. For JWT support as API key, index_api.html (originally index.html) changed with the following:
            //JWT hack: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/818
            function addApiKeyAuthorization(){
                var key = encodeURIComponent( $('#input_apiKey')[0].value );
                if(key && key.trim() != "") {
                    var apiKeyAuth = new SwaggerClient.ApiKeyAuthorization( "Authorization", "Bearer " + key, "header" );
                    window.swaggerUi.api.clientAuthorizations.add( "bearer", apiKeyAuth );
                    log( "Set bearer token: " + key );
                }
            }
. Due to the issue https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/1382, swagger-client.js AND swagger-ui.js is modified at two places as at:
    var pick = 1; if(this.url.indexOf('localhost') > -1) pick = 0;
    this.schemes[pick]; /*SWG1*/
. All custom changes are tagged with SWG1
. If you overwrite the changes with bower install for some reason, the changed copy has extenstion .SWG1 e.g.
c:\GoogleAppEngine>copy war\n\js\swagger-client.js.SWG1 war\n\js\bower_components\swagger-js\browser\swagger-client.js
c:\GoogleAppEngine>copy war\n\js\swagger-ui.js.SWG1 war\swagger\swagger-ui.js

JSON Web Token (JWT)
. The working codes are based on http://niels.nu/blog/2015/json-web-tokens.html
. JWT protected api has to be /api/jwt/* as /api is already reserved for Spring MVC api (which is not JWT-enabled), aka /api/jwt/* are JWT-enabled REST services while /api/* where * is not jwt is not!
. The configurations are done inside dispatcher-servlet.xml, web.xml as well as via @RequestMapping of UserController and ApiController
. It's main dependency (if you are not using Maven, obviously this project does not use Maven), is https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt e.g. jjwt-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
. To apply a site specific secret key, say 1234567890, invoke:
http://localhost:8888/postsettings?setting=1234567890&pincode=secretkey.common
. To view it:
http://localhost:8888/settings?pincode=secretkey.common

FalcorJS
. It is experimental and it is not ready (due to a need to have the JSON response in a form of JSONGraph mainly)

Results
. The non-scientific preliminary results
AngularJS 25 hours
ReactJS
RiotJS
. It does not include APIMATIC integrations and/or anything non-UI related

SwaggerClient 2.1.10
. No code generations needed
. Just look at the swagger.json and invoke anything in the format of tags.operationId e.g. pet.getPetById
. Sadly by looking at the defacto Swagger UI interface, it is confusing to see what are the operation ids, thus tools like http://json2table.com/ is probably better
. Good reference is at https://libraries.io/npm/swagger-client/2.1.10

AngularJS to ReactJS in few sentences
. Move all HTML codes into .jsx file
. Added SwaggerClient codes to retrive the results from the backend/datastore
. Add an HTML tag to mount a React component
. Render the tag with the React component
. Decorate all properties with {this.property} if required (for read only view)
. Add event handler if applicable (for saving form etc)

OWASP Notes:
. ReactJS
-dangerouslySetInnerHTML should only be called if it is not directly from the user input; otherwise it has to be sanitized before submission
